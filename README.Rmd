An implementation of the Growing Neural Gas algorithm in Rcpp.

## Example

Here's an example of running a GNG on the iris dataset (which, arguably, doesn't make much sense).
```{r iris}
library(gng)
data(iris)

x <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
gng_fit <- gng(x)
```

You can visualise the GNG nodes as follows.
```{r plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
plot_gng(gng_fit, plot_labels = iris[,5])
plot_gng(gng_fit, plot_labels = iris[,5], plot_expression = NULL)
plot_gng(gng_fit)
```
